#+title: DOOM on Emacs

This is [[https://github.com/id-Software/DOOM][DOOM]] running inside Emacs via a native module. The port is based on
[[https://github.com/ozkl/doomgeneric][doomgeneric]] such that only a handful of functions like ~DG_DrawFrame~ need to be
[[file:doomgeneric/doomgeneric_emacs.c][implemented in C]] with some [[file:doom.el][Elisp code as glue]]. It uses the native Canvas API
which is not yet part of the Emacs source tree (see the [[https://github.com/minad/emacs-canvas-patch][patch]] and the
[[https://debbugs.gnu.org/cgi/bugreport.cgi?bug=80281][discussion]]).

In order to run DOOM, you first need to apply the Canvas patch to the Emacs
source and recompile Emacs. Then execute ~./run.sh~ to compile the module and
start DOOM on Emacs. You will need a WAD file which contains the game data. The
file ~doom1.wad~ is freely available.
